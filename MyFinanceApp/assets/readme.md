Here is assets that will be used throughout the entire component, but are not necessarily React based.

## CPP
Holds the implementation of our C++ classes.

## WASM
Holds the compiled C++ to Web Assembly file. Is made up of all 3 classes that were converted into the `FinaceApp` JavaScript and WebAssembly files (.js, .wasm) to be able to implement in JavaScript and TypeScript, as a result.
