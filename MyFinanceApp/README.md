# Welcome to the Stringfellowship's app ðŸ‘‹
## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set Up your environment
   Whether you choose to connect your device directly to your computer to run it, or choose to emulate it, decide which method you will need to set it up. Do **not** use the web option, as SQLite will have issues running on the web as the library can only handle an IOS or Android device. It is reccomended you **set up with expo go** as this was the choosen environment that enables cross-platform capabilities.
- [Documentation to set up](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

3. Run the app
  Now that you have your environment set up, run the app based on it.
```bash
// android environment
npm run android

// ios environment
npm run ios

// start up indiscriminately
npm run start
```
